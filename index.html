      <p>There was this one time when my mind was running completely open and I was just typing in this text editor.
        I began to realize that I was typing in the present, but why. I told myself to just keep typing no matter what.
        What ever comes to mind.
      </p>  
      <p>So the story goes like this... John Erysian was trying to hustle one business day. Like usual, 
        John was giving it his all. 
         He really wanted me to go to ITT TECH. Now, I can say one thing for certain I really enjoyed my talk with John.  
         I could not stop thinking about his rediculous yet mesmerizing voice, it was almost like I was talking to a sports broadcaster but 10 times more intense.
      </p>
      <p>Moral of the story is that John Erysian will live on as a legend.  He will live on in my voice-mailbox forever.
